# Palindrome Number Checker

## Description:
Write a Python program to determine if a given integer is a palindrome number or not. A palindrome number is one that remains the same when its digits are reversed.

### Input 
- An integer `num` (1 ≤ num ≤ 10^9) to be checked for being a palindrome.

### Constraints
- The input integer `num` can be at most 9 digits long.

### Output
- Print "Yes" if the number is a palindrome; otherwise, print "No."

### Examples
```
Input:
121

Output:
Yes

Explanation:
121 is a palindrome because it reads the same forwards and backwards.

---

Input:
12321

Output:
Yes

Explanation:
12321 is a palindrome because it reads the same forwards and backwards.

---

Input:
12345

Output:
No

Explanation:
12345 is not a palindrome because it does not read the same forwards and backwards.
```
